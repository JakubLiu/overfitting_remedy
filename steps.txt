1. add more predictors to the nD distribution approach (DONE)
2. test the multiple 1D distributions approach by changing the beta values
3. test both approaches on real world data that suit a simple linear regression

    - real world data available from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhil7280/student-performance-multiple-linear-regression?resource=download
    - Y is the performance index
    - maybe add some noise to Y
